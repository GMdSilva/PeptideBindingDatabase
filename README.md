	top19_dataset/
	
		<Same as much of the above, but here's how this dataset was haphazardly generated:>
		
		Sort pdbbind_moad_dataset_filtered by [score_average] (increasing)
			then:
				grab the 19 first entries
				
				These should be the 19 "most diverse" entries in the dataset in terms of structure and sequence similarity of the receptor, but curation is needed as sometimes structures are very dissimilar from all but one other entry, leading to similar structures being selected as diverse
				
				Still, despite being haphazardly-generated, this dataset is surprisingly complete
				
				Affinity values range from 0.01 mM (kI) to 3400 mM (kd), with decent distribution
				
				Peptide SS is somewhat diverse, with 3 helical peptides, 4 beta-sheet peptides, and 12 coils
				
				Protein function keywords and buried surface areas are also quite diverse (see figures)
